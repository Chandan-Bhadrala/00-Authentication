## Need to include

- Register, Login, Logout, jwt (may be refresh & access token) & change password & change profile pic (delete old profile pic from cloudinary after successful addition of the profile pic in the cloudinary).

- Mailing services for verify email, forgot password.

- Add functionality to check for "username availability" on spot in FE. ChatGPt, on how to achieve this behavior.

- Create a super admin route, who can convert any user into an admin or back to user.
